## Hardware

### Goals:

1. Team Up
2. 
3. Input/Output
4. Read


#### 1. Team Up
We have a limited number of Arduino Inventor Kits, so you'll most likely need to find a partner. Please try to keep groups capped at 2 people. 


#### 2. 

#### 3. Input/Output
You're not required to use the Arduino Kits, if you're more comfortable with some other electronics hardware that is also ok. What we're interested in is how to acquire physical input and then use it for some kind of output. Simplistically speaking, Jim Campbell's [Formula for Computer Art](http://www.jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/miscellaneous_references/); but hopefully conceptually interesting and/or visually/aurally/other captivating ...
